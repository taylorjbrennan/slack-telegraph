Slack Portal
===============

Creates a link between two or more teams in slack.

Can be deployed as a server or AWS lambda.

Configure an outgoing webhook and incoming webhook to point to a single channel on each team. This channel will be the "portal". Add the necessary info to `config.json` once this is completed, then direct each outgoing webhook to the server.
